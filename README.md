# Windup Wizards

This is the source code for the game [Windup Wizards](https://pandaqi.com/windup-wizards).

It contains two parts: the actual game (Godot 3) and the simulation that generates random puzzles (written in Rust).

It was made for the GoGodot Jam 2, then given some extra puzzles and improvements (based on feedback) afterwards.
